# JuliaSyntax

[![Build Status](https://github.com/c42f/JuliaSyntax.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c42f/JuliaSyntax.jl/actions)

Yet another Julia frontend, written in Julia.

Goals:
* Parse Julia code with precise source mapping (concrete syntax trees)
* Avoid worrying about how much work this will be ðŸ˜…

Nice to have:
* Speedy enough for interactive editing
* Production quality error recovery and reporting
* "Compilation as an API" to support all sorts of tooling
* Go further than parsing - macro expansion, syntax desugaring and scope analysis
* Code which is correct, fast and understandable
